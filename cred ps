$psCred = Get-StoredCredential -Target "CGSPS1"
Connect-MSolService -Credential $psCred

i stored my credentials in credentials manager as CGSPS1 and i tried retrieving them in ps1
$psCred = Get-StoredCredential -Target "CGSPS1" –AsCredentialObject

$CRED = Get-StoredCredential -Target "CGSPS1" –AsCredentialObject
Connect-MSolService -Credential $CRED
and i get the below error

Connect-MsolService : Cannot bind parameter 'Credential'. Cannot convert the "PSCredentialManager.Common.Credential" value of t
"PSCredentialManager.Common.Credential" to type "System.Management.Automation.PSCredential".

+ Connect-MSolService -Credential $cred

$username = "admin@domain.com"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "mypassword" -AsPlainText -Force
$psCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ($username, $password)
Import-Module MSOnline
Connect-MSolService -Credential $psCred
$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $psCred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection 
Import-PSSession $Session -AllowClobber -DisableNameChecking

Then, in PowerShell, Wherever you use 

$cred = Get-Credential

which prompts you, replace that with

$cred =$(Get-StoredCredential -Target thenameyoustoredyourcredentialunder)

Is there a way to get around using "$cred = Get-Credential" without a prompt 

 

The script i am trying to use is 

# Connect to Office 365 
# 

$username = ""
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "mypassword" -AsPlainText -Force
#$secureStringPwd = $password | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ($user, $password)
Import-Module MSOnline 
$cred = Get-Credential 
Connect-MSolService -credential $cred 
$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection 
Import-PSSession $Session -AllowClobber -DisableNameChecking
